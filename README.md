Case Study 1 Final Deliverable

A. Study Overview: 
Social media sites, dating apps, and information search sites have been used to reach individuals at high risk for
HIV infection. However, it is not clear which platform is the most efficient in promoting home HIV self-testing, given that the
users of various platforms may have different characteristics that impact their readiness for HIV testing. 

This study's primary objective is to compare the relative effectiveness of social media sites, dating apps, and information search sites in promoting HIV self-testing among minority men who have sex with men (MSM) at an increased risk of HIV infection. Test kit order rates were used as a proxy to evaluate promotion effectiveness. In addition, a secondary objective is to assess differences in characteristics between participants who ordered and did not order an HIV test kit.
